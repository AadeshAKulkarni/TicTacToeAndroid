Hey Guys. <br>
This is my first Project on Github.<br>

This project is <b>an Android Two-Player App</b> with simple rules covering all features in simplicity.<br> 
Each Game has 2 Players and 5 Rounds. (Best of 5) ---// You can set the Round limit as per your wish.<br>
After 5 Rounds, The Winner is announced and Game is restarted again. <br>

<b><h2>Screenshots of the App:</h2></b>

<b><h2>Future Scope of this Project:</h2></b><br>
1. Play Againist CPU (Single Player) --- // probably need to implement MinMax BackTracking Algorithm.<br>
2. A Settings Screen (to adjust difficulty level if playing with the CPU, also number of rounds to play in each game, etc)<br>
3. Multiplayer on Wifi/Lan (Using 2 Mobile Phones)<br>
