Hey Guys. <br>
This is my first Project on Github.<br>

This project is <b>an Android Two-Player App</b> with simple rules covering all features in simplicity.<br> 
Each Game has 2 Players and 5 Rounds. (Best of 5) ---// You can set the Round limit as per your wish.<br>
After 5 Rounds, The Winner is announced and then the Game is restarted again. <br>
